# Safety Click Razor Project

## Description
This project focuses on the design and development of a **Safety Click Razor**, aimed at enhancing the shaving experience while being eco-friendly. The project incorporates a **click mechanism** to lock the blades into place and **topology optimization** for efficient use of materials and better structural integrity.

## Key Features:
- **Click Mechanism**: Provides an easy and safe way to lock the razor head to the stem.
- **40-Degree Head Adjustment**: Offers customizable shaving angles for better performance.
- **Eco-Friendly Design**: Uses recyclable materials such as ABS plastic and stainless steel.

## Materials:
- **Stem**: 17-4 PH Stainless Steel.
- **Razor Head**: ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) for lightweight and durable design.

## Software and Tools Used:
- **SolidWorks**: For CAD design and simulations.
- **Topology Optimization**: Used to reduce material waste in the design.
- **Additive Manufacturing**: For producing the final product.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/prasadvnv/Safety-Click-Razor.git
2. Open the SolidWorks files for design inspection and modification.
3. Use the STL files for 3D printing the parts.
